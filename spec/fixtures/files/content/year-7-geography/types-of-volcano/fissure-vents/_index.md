title: Fissure vents
description: |-
  A fissure vent, also known as a volcanic fissure, eruption
  fissure or simply a fissure, is a linear volcanic vent through
  which lava erupts, usually without any explosive activity. The
  vent is often a few metres wide and may be many kilometres long.
  Fissure vents can cause large flood basalts which run first in
  lava channels and later in lava tubes. After some time the
  eruption builds up spatter cones and may concentrate on one or
  some of them. Small fissure vents may not be easily discernible
  from the air, but the crater rows or the canyons built up by some
  of them are.

  In Iceland, volcanic vents, which can be long fissures, often
  open parallel to the rift zones where the Eurasian and the North
  American Plate lithospheric plates are diverging, a system which
  is part of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Renewed eruptions generally
  occur from new parallel fractures offset by a few hundred to
  thousands of metres from the earlier fissures. This distribution
  of vents and sometimes voluminous eruptions of fluid basaltic
  lava usually builds up a thick lava plateau, rather than a single
  volcanic edifice. But there are also the central volcanoes,
  composite volcanoes, often with calderas, which have been formed
  during thousands of years, and eruptions with one or more magma
  reservoirs underneath controlling their respective fissure system
