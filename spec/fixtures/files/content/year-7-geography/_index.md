The lessons in this unit have been planned progressively to enable pupils
to retain powerful knowledge and vocabulary that can be used confidently
later in life. Progressively planned learning enables children to apply
prior knowledge and build upon it. This approach solidifies learning
beyond learning facts in the classroom, allowing knowledge to be stored
in pupilsâ€™ long-term memories.
