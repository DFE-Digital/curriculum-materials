Give students slips of paper at random, but make sure the student with the first event knows who they are. Get them to read out their slip and see how smoothly the whole class can get through the story. This exercise requires participants to have understood the order of events and be alert for when their turn to read arises. Teachers can make this more competitive by making students start again if there is a pause of more than a couple of seconds between each student.
