    benefits: <<~BENEFITS
      The lessons in this unit have been planned progressively to enable pupils
      to retain powerful knowledge and vocabulary that can be used confidently
      later in life. Progressively planned learning enables children to apply
      prior knowledge and build upon it. This approach solidifies learning
      beyond learning facts in the classroom, allowing knowledge to be stored
      in pupilsâ€™ long-term memories."

            Plate tectonics is a theory of geology. It explains movement of the
            Earth's lithosphere: this is the earth's crust and the upper part
            of the mantle. The lithosphere is divided into plates, some of which
            are very large and can be entire continents.)

            A map is an image of an area, usually of the Earth or part of the
            Earth. A map is different from an aerial photograph because it
            includes interpretation. Many maps are called "charts" such as star
            charts and nautical charts. Before the late 20th century almost all
            maps were on paper. Now they are more often seen on a computer
            screen.)

          overview: <<~OVERVIEW
            Shaking and ground rupture are the main effects created by
            earthquakes, principally resulting in more or less severe damage to
            buildings and other rigid structures. The severity of the local
            effects depends on the complex combination of the earthquake
            magnitude, the distance from the epicenter, and the local geological
            and geomorphological conditions, which may amplify or reduce wave
            propagation.)
