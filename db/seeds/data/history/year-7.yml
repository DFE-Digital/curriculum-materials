    ### How curriculum content is sequenced throughout year 7

    Year 7 begins with coverage of some essential historical skills that will
    underpin what students do throughout their time in history lessons
    including chronology, source skills, interpretations and technical
    terminology.

    Some of these skills are then applied via an in depth study of the life of
    Julius Caesar. This is linked with Shakespeareâ€™s interpretation of Caesar,
    and thus historical interpretations in general. It also provides an
    opportunity for some cross-curricular drama work which students find to be
    engaging and different but remains academically rigorous.

    ### Key themes, changes, and continuities

    The journey through British history then begins with a study of medieval
    realms, covering the key themes mentioned above. Study then moves on to the
    Tudor monarchs followed by the English Civil War.

    Thematically, interleaving is crucial as curriculum content consistently
    returns to the key themes and the overarching changes and continuities that
    can be observed moving through British history. In terms of key skills,
    each assessment has a different skills focus in order to build up the
    requirements of GCSE history.
