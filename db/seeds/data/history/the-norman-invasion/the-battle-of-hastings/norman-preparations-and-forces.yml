    In the course of the 10th century, the initially destructive incursions of
    Norse war bands going upstream into the rivers of France penetrated further
    into interior Europe, and evolved into more permanent encampments that
    included local French women and personal property.
  summary: |-
    William assembled a large invasion fleet and an army gathered from
    Normandy and all over France, including large contingents from Brittany
    and Flanders. He mustered his forces at Saint-Valery-sur-Somme and was
    ready to cross the Channel by about 12 August. The exact numbers and
    composition of William's force are unknown. A contemporary document
    claims that William had 726 ships, but this may be an inflated figure.
    Figures given by contemporary writers are highly exaggerated, varying
    from 14,000 to 150,000 men.

    Modern historians have offered a range of estimates for the size of
    William's forces; 7000–8000 men, 1000–2000 of them cavalry; 10,000–12,000
    men; 10,000 men, 3000 of them cavalry; or 7500 men. The army would have
    consisted of a mix of cavalry, infantry, and archers or crossbowmen, with
    about equal numbers of cavalry and archers and the foot soldiers equal in
    number to the other two types combined.  Although later lists of
    companions of William the Conqueror are extant, most are padded with
    extra names; only about 35 individuals can be reliably claimed to have
    been with William at Hastings.

    William of Poitiers states that William obtained Pope Alexander II's consent
    for the invasion, signified by a papal banner, along with diplomatic support
    from other European rulers. Although Alexander did give papal approval to the
    conquest after it succeeded, no other source claims papal support before the
    invasion.[f] William's army assembled during the summer while an invasion fleet
    in Normandy was constructed. Although the army and fleet were ready by early
    August, adverse winds kept the ships in Normandy until late September. There
    were probably other reasons for William's delay, including intelligence reports
    from England revealing that Harold's forces were deployed along the coast.
    William would have preferred to delay the invasion until he could make an
    unopposed landing
