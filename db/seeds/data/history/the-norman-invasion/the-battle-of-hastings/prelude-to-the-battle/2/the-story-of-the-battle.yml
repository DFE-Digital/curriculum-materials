activity:
  name: The story of the battle
  overview: |-
      Give students slips of paper at random, but make sure the
      student with the first event knows who they are. Get them
      to read out their slip and see how smoothly the whole class
      can get through the story.

      This exercise requires participants to have understood
      the order of events and be alert for when their turn to
      read arises. Teachers can make this more competitive by
      making students start again if there is a pause of more
      than a couple of seconds between each student.
