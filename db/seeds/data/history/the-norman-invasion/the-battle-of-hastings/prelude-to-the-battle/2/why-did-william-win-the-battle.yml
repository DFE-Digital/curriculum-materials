  name: Why did William win the battle?
  overview: |-
      Students can work individually, in pairs or in groups for this activity.
      Instructions for the activity are on slide 9. Students decide which
      statements on the cards are irrelevant to answering the question “Why did
      William win the Battle of Hastings?” and discard them. Then they
      categorise the cards under different headings. Higher attainers can be
      encouraged to come up with their own category headings or think of
      alternatives to the one you give them.
