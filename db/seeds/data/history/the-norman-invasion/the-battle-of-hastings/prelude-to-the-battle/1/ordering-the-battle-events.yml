activity:
  name: Ordering the battle events
  overview: |-
    For this lesson, students need to know the events of
    the battle in chronological order. The teacher uses
    maps on slides 6 and 7 to remind students what led up
    to the battle. Students then read the Word document
    “description of the Battle of Hastings” either as a
    group taking it in turns to read aloud or
    independently.
