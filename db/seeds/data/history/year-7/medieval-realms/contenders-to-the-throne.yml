lesson:
  name: Contenders to the throne

  learning_objective: |-
    To evaluate the main contenders for the throne of England in 1066.

  position: 2
  misconceptions: |-
    This lesson provides a good opportunity to address the difficulties
    presented by ambiguous pieces of evidence, such as the section of the
    Bayeux tapestry that appears to show Harold Godwinson being killed with
    an arrow to the eye. Teachers can refer to the slide that shows this
    section of the story and show students that it isn’t actually clear who
    is being hit with the arrow. Lots of students will have heard this story
    as historical fact and this is a chance to demonstrate how evidence
    relating to historical events can be interpreted in different ways.

  vocabulary: |-
    * Anglo-Saxon
    * heir
    * claimant
    * oath

  # This contains several fields' worth of data, it needs restructuring
  core_knowledge_for_teachers: |-
    Students will have studied the succession crisis of 1066 and the build up
    to the Battle of Hastings, including an examination of the claimants to the
    throne, preparations for conflict and the Battle of Stamford Bridge. The
    purpose of this lesson is to ensure students know the reasons William was
    able to achieve victory, can develop them into increasingly sophisticated
    explanations, and understand some of the issues with evidence from this
    period (and historical evidence in general.) How historical factors work
    together, leading to a particular conclusion, is the main focus in this
    lesson and something students will return to consistently throughout the
    key stage.

    There is an episode of the documentary series ‘Battlefield Britain’
    presented by Dan Snow that covers the Battle of Hastings and preceding
    months in detail, with a focus on battlefield tactics.

  core_knowledge_for_pupils: |-
    Pupils should be able to explain the key reasons William of Normandy won the
    Battle of Hastings and be able to categorise those reasons. Higher attainers
    will be able to offer more detailed explanations of how each factor contributed
    to victory, whereas lower attainers may just be able to identify reasons and
    begin to start explaining them. Pupils should be encouraged to reflect on the
    nature of historical evidence, how we reach conclusions about the past, and
    what constitutes relevant information when addressing a specific historical
    question.

  previous_knowledge: |-
    This is the first lesson of a new topic, so students should be familiar with
    basic historical terminology, but nothing specific yet about the Norman
    Conquest or Medieval England.
