        Evidence is not always totally clear about what happened in 1066 so
        teachers should continually remind students that reaching a conclusion is
        about deciding what the evidence would suggest, rather than absolute
        certainty, especially when it comes to things like Haroldâ€™s oath to
        William.

        Much of the evidence we do have about this oath is gained from the
        writings of Oderic Vitalis, a Norman chronicler. Although modern
        historians regard Vitalis as a relatively reliable source, he would have
        wanted to emphasise the legitimacy of the Norman claim given that he was
        writing decades after the conquest.

    By the end of the lesson, pupils should know:

    Students should gain a very brief overview of Anglo-Saxon England. They should
    also understand why there was a succession crisis in 1066, who the main
    contenders for the throne were, and why there was disagreement over the
    validity of those claims. This lesson is not focused on the reliability of
    evidence, but this could be looked at in anticipation of further work on
    sources/interpretations later in the unit.

  summary: |-

      This is the first lesson of a new topic, so students should be familiar with
      basic historical terminology, but nothing specific yet about the Norman
      Conquest or Medieval England.
