  core_knowledge_for_pupils: |-
    When William heard the news that Harold had become king his reaction was
    swift. He called a meeting of his greatest men.  William made plans to gather
    a large army from all over France. His influence and wealth meant he could
    mount a large campaign. His first task was to build a fleet of ships to carry
    his army across the English Channel. Then he started gathering an army. His
    friendship with Brittany, France, and Flanders meant he did not have to rely
    only on his own army. He hired and paid soldiers from many parts of Europe.

    William asked for and got the support of the pope who gave him a banner to
    carry into battle. At the same time Duke William was planning his invasion so
    too was Harald Hardrada. The king of England knew both would be coming but he
    kept his ships and forces in the south of England where William might land.
    William may have had as many as 1,000 ships in his invasion fleet. They had
    favorable winds to leave Normandy on the night of 27 September 1066.
    William's ship, the Mora, was a gift of his wife, Matilda. It led the fleet
    to the landing at Pevensey the next morning. As soon as he landed William got
    news of King Harold's victory over the Norwegian king at Stamford Bridge in
    the north of England.

    Harold also received news that William had landed at
    Pevensey and came south as quickly as he could. The king rested at London for
    a few days before taking his army to meet William and his French forces.

      ### Who was Harold Godwinson?:

      Harold was a son of Godwin (c. 1001–1053), the powerful Earl of
      Wessex, and of Gytha Thorkelsdóttir, whose brother Ulf the Earl
      was married to Estrid Svendsdatter (c. 1015/1016), the daughter
      of King Sweyn Forkbeard (died 1014) and sister of King Cnut the
      Great of England and Denmark.

      Ulf and Estrith's son would become King Sweyn II of Denmark in 1047.
      Godwin was the son of Wulfnoth, probably a thegn and a native of
      Sussex. Godwin began his political career by supporting King Edmund
      Ironside (reigned April to November 1016), but switched to supporting
      King Cnut by 1018, when Cnut named him Earl of Wessex.

      ### Who are the Normans?

      The Norman dynasty had a major political, cultural and military impact on
      medieval Europe and the Near East. The Normans were famed for their martial
      spirit and eventually for their Catholic piety, becoming exponents of the
      Catholic orthodoxy of the Romance community into which they assimilated.

      They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled,
      their dialect becoming known as Norman, Normaund or Norman French, an
      important literary language which is still spoken today in parts of
      Normandy and the nearby Channel Islands. The Duchy of Normandy, which they
      formed by treaty with the French crown, was a great fief of medieval
      France, and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and
      formidable principality in feudal tenure.

      ### Who was William the Conqueror:

      William was the son of the unmarried Robert I, Duke of Normandy, by his
      mistress Herleva. His illegitimate status and his youth caused some
      difficulties for him after he succeeded his father, as did the anarchy
      which plagued the first years of his rule. During his childhood and
      adolescence, members of the Norman aristocracy battled each other, both for
      control of the child duke and for their own ends.

      In 1047, William was able to quash a rebellion and begin to establish
      his authority over the duchy, a process that was not complete until
      about 1060. His marriage in the 1050s to Matilda of Flanders provided
      him with a powerful ally in the neighbouring county of Flanders. By the
      time of his marriage, William was able to arrange the appointment of
      his supporters as bishops and abbots in the Norman church. His
      consolidation of power allowed him to expand his horizons, and he
      secured control of the neighbouring county of Maine by 1062.
