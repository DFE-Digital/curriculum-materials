activity:
  name: "Understand propaganda: create a poster"
  overview: |-
    Discuss examples of political propaganda with students. Draw out what makes
    an effective piece of political propaganda and get students to apply this
    to the candidates for the throne in 1066. Sketches should be rough as this
    isnâ€™t an artistic challenge. The focus should be on conveying a message.
