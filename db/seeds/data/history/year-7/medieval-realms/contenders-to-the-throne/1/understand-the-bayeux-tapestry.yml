activity:
  name: "Picture source: understand the Bayeux Tapestry"
  overview: |-
    Give students a busy section of the Bayeux Tapestry to look at to see if
    they can make any inferences about what is happening. Students should not
    be expected to work out exactly what is going on (it is the scene where
    Harold Godwinson allegedly swears an oath to William of Normandy, possibly
    in reality under duress) but could point out things like the weapons,
    throne, or ship and draw some inferences from these things.
