    The unit is intended to provide a firm foundation for the rest of key stage
    3 history where students will return repeatedly to key themes and skills.

    ### How this lesson sequence benefits pupils' learning

    The medieval realms unit weaves together key knowledge, skills and
    understanding required throughout key stage 3 history.

    #### The ability to recognise fundamental themes

    There is a broadly chronological approach to the period, but within this there
    are two key fundamental themes: political power (the Norman conquest,
    Feudalism, conflict between church and crown, the Magna Carta and the
    Peasants' Revolt) and religion, beliefs and attitudes (the Catholic church,
    the importance of religion in daily life, Thomas Becket, the Crusades and the
    Black Death).

    #### Examination and analysis of ordinary life

    Schools may also opt, if they have the time, to undertake an examination of
    life for ordinary people through a focus on medieval towns and villages as
    well as crime and punishment.

    #### The development of key historical skills

    The unit also offers a focus on a range of key historical skills. Students
    develop their understanding of causation in history through their study of
    the Battle of Hastings, Thomas Becket, Magna Carta and the Peasants'
    Revolt, whilst their examination of the importance of religion uses primary
    sources to draw conclusions.

    Interpretations of history are addressed primarily via their study of King
    Richard and King John, and accounts of the death of Wat Tyler.
