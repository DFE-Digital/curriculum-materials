activity:
  name: Students score their partner's work
  overview: |-
      Ask students to use the checklist on the slide to feed back
      on the work of the person next to them. They can either
      award a mark for each element of the checklist that is
      present, or write a “what went well” and an “even better
      if” for their partner.
