  core_knowledge: |-
    In early 1066, Harold's exiled brother Tostig Godwinson raided southeastern
    England with a fleet he had recruited in Flanders, later joined by other
    ships from Orkney. Threatened by Harold's fleet, Tostig moved north and
    raided in East Anglia and Lincolnshire. He was driven back to his ships by
    the brothers Edwin, Earl of Mercia and Morcar, Earl of Northumbria.

    Deserted by most of his followers, he withdrew to Scotland, where he spent
    the middle of the year recruiting fresh forces. Hardrada invaded
    northern England in early September, leading a fleet of more than 300 ships
    carrying perhaps 15,000 men. Hardrada's army was further augmented by the
    forces of Tostig, who supported the Norwegian king's bid for the throne.
    Advancing on York, the Norwegians occupied the city after defeating a
    northern English army under Edwin and Morcar on 20 September at the Battle
    of Fulford.

  summary: |-
    After defeating his brother Tostig and Harald Hardrada in the north, Harold
    left much of his forces in the north, including Morcar and Edwin, and
    marched the rest of his army south to deal with the threatened Norman
    invasion. It is unclear when Harold learned of William's landing, but it
    was probably while he was travelling south. Harold stopped in London, and
    was there for about a week before Hastings, so it is likely that he spent
    about a week on his march south, averaging about 27 miles per day, for the
    approximately 200 miles.

    Harold camped at Caldbec Hill on the night of 13 October, near what was
    described as a "hoar-apple tree". This location was about 8 miles (13
    kilometres) from William's castle at Hastings. Some of the early
    contemporary French accounts mention an emissary or emissaries sent by
    Harold to William, which is likely. Nothing came of these efforts.

    Although Harold attempted to surprise the Normans, William's scouts
    reported the English arrival to the duke. The exact events preceding the
    battle are obscure, with contradictory accounts in the sources, but all
    agree that William led his army from his castle and advanced towards the
    enemy. Harold had taken a defensive position at the top of Senlac Hill
    (present-day Battle, East Sussex), about 6 miles (9.7 kilometres) from
    William's castle at Hastings.

  previous_knowledge:
    Harald Sigurdsson: |-
      Also known as Harald of Norway (Old Norse: Haraldr Sigurðarson; c. 1015 –
      25 September 1066) and given the epithet Hardrada (Old Norse: harðráði,
      modern Norwegian: Hardråde, roughly translated as "stern counsel" or
      "hard ruler") in the sagas, was King of Norway (as Harald III) from
      1046 to 1066. In addition, he unsuccessfully claimed the Danish throne
      until 1064 and the English throne in 1066. Before becoming king, Harald
      had spent around fifteen years in exile as a mercenary and military
      commander in Kievan Rus' and of the Varangian Guard in the Byzantine
      Empire.

    Tostig Godwinson: |-
      Tostig Godwinson was an Anglo-Saxon Earl of Northumbria and brother of
      King Harold Godwinson. After being exiled by his brother, Tostig
      supported the Norwegian king Harald Hardrada's invasion of England, and
      was killed at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066.
