    The lessons in this programme have been planned progressively to enable
    pupils to retain powerful knowledge and vocabulary that can be used
    confidently later in life. Progressively planned learning enables children
    to apply prior knowledge and build upon it. This approach solidifies
    learning beyond learning facts in the classroom, allowing knowledge to be
    stored in pupilsâ€™ long-term memories.
