  rationale: |-
    The lessons in this unit have been planned progressively to enable pupils to
    retain powerful knowledge and vocabulary that can be used confidently later
    in life. Progressively planned learning enables children to apply prior
    knowledge and build upon it. This approach solidifies learning beyond
    learning facts in the classroom, allowing knowledge to be stored in pupilsâ€™
    long-term memories.
