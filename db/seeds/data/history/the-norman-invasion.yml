  overview: |-
    The Battle of Hastings was fought on 14 October 1066 between the
    Norman-French army of William, the Duke of Normandy, and an English army
    under the Anglo-Saxon King Harold Godwinson, beginning the Norman conquest of

    The lessons in this unit have been planned progressively to enable pupils to
    retain powerful knowledge and vocabulary that can be used confidently later
    in life. Progressively planned learning enables children to apply prior
    knowledge and build upon it. This approach solidifies learning beyond
    learning facts in the classroom, allowing knowledge to be stored in pupilsâ€™
    long-term memories.
