      markdown:
        Access curriculum resources is a service for teachers. It enables them to
        access their schoolâ€™s curriculum online, including all the lesson plans,
        resources, and subject knowledge they will need to teach it.

        The Department for Education has collaborated with educational experts to
        create a service that aims to give all students access to a high-quality
        curriculum and to reduce teacher workload, with all teaching materials
        available to download or print from the service.

        The curriculum programmes available through this service are rooted in the
        traditions of subject disciplines and embrace learnings from cognitive science.
        Units of work have been coherently sequenced to ensure students gain specific
        knowledge that can be remembered in detail.
